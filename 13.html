                <h2>SECTION 13: PROJECTS</h2>
                <h3>13.1 Introduction</h3>
                <p>All committees, teams and chapters are involved in projects, jointly or separately. <br>
                These are initiated at all levels: from Chapters themselves, or by Committees or even at Board of Directors level. </p>
                <p>There are many types of EWB-HK projects, including:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Small construction projects: design and construction or repair of community health centers, schools, and shelter systems;</li>
                    <li>Water and sanitation projects: provision of potable water, and wastewater management projects;</li>
                    <li>Renewable energy projects: design and installation of photovoltaic systems, wind, biodiesel.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There are certain fields that EWB-HK will not support:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A project that benefits a single person or family;</li>
                    <li>Projects that require fixed salaries, operational costs, or rolling funds for daily functioning </li>
                    <li>Projects with military implications or having solely commercial, religious, or political objectives;</li>
                    <li>Projects involving purchase of vehicles, dynamite, detonators, medicines, or consumable goods not related to construction.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Priority is given to projects that incorporate the following characteristics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The project responds to a need or real problem in the community;</li>
                    <li>In responding to this need, due consideration is given to ensure no unintended damage occurs over the long term to the community structure or to the surrounding environment/ecosystem.</li>
                    <li>The project benefits a significant portion of community members;</li>
                    <li>Commitment of individuals or groups from the community to maintain and assure the continuity of the project (such individuals may receive training from EWB-HK);</li>
                    <li>The community contributes significantly to the execution of the project;</li>
                    <li>The project represents the organization and effort of a collective, and not one single person;</li>
                    <li>The project makes use of technology that is appropriate to the specific community;</li>
                    <li>The project goals are clearly understood by project personnel and realistically achievable.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The following critical issues are addressed when considering a project for EWB-HK participation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Who asked EWB-HK to get involved?</li>
                    <li>Does the project "fit" within the EWB-HK mission, values, and strategic plan?</li>
                    <li>Is the anticipated positive impact of the project on the community quantifiable?</li>
                    <li>Have potential negative impacts been assessed and minimized, both in terms of long-term temporal effects as well as adoption of this technology over a larger spatial scale?</li>
                    <li>Are cultural, environmental and ecosystem considerations included?</li>
                    <li>Is there potential for partnering / teaming with local or regional organizations?</li>
                    <li>Are there local engineers, students, schools, university contacts, project managers / funding agencies to participate or contribute to the project?</li>
                    <li>What is the time frame of commitment to the project and local community?</li>
                    <li>What are the local community’s expectations and contributions for the project?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>13.2 Project Process</h3>
                <p>In order to optimize and standardize handling of projects, EWB-HK has created a procedure to plan, manage and execute projects of all types. <br>
                The overall procedure could be exemplified by the following Project Step Cycle:</p>
                <img src="image/cycle.png">
                <h4>INITIATE: Identify the Opportunity and get to know each other</h4>
                <p>1.   Project Identification and Background</p>
                <p>The starting point of each project is the “5 Ws”: Who, Where, What, When and Why. <br>
                At this stage it is useful to clarify each of the 5 W and the project beneficiaries, plus means of delivery and potential partners. <br>
                Opportunities are identified and assessed. <br>
                An initial Project Introduction may to be prepared at this stage. </p>
                <p>2.   Partner Due Diligence and Approval</p>
                <p>This is a crucial step in the project and EWB-HK has developed tools to ensure we only cooperate with professional partners in a systematic way. <br>
                As soon as a partner is identified, the Team Leader is requested to fill in a Partner Evaluation Questionnaire (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.1 - Partner Evaluation.xlsx" download="">Appendix 13.2.1</a>). For HKPC, use <a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.1b500 - HKPC Partnering Project Information Form.doc" download> Appendix 13.2.1b - HKPC Partnering Project Information Form</a>. <br>
                The candidate partner will then need to be provided EWB-HK standard Partner Handbook (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.2 - Partner Handbook.docx" download> Appendix 13.2.2</a>) and they will need to sign its acceptance, as agreement of the common operating principles during the project. <br>
                Both documents will therefore need to be presented to the Committee Chairman for Patrner Approval. A Partner Approval does not ensure automatic Project Approval: only the possibility of cooperation with the candidate partner submitted for evaluation. <br>
                For HKPC, please reference sample agreement in <a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.2b HKPC Cooperation Agreement Sample.docx" download=""> appendices/Appendix 13.2.2b HKPC Cooperation Agreement Sample</a>.</p>
                <h4>PLAN: Produce a Program Brief (Scope and Deliverables) through collaboration and site investigation</h4>
                <p>3.   Site Investigation and Survey</p>
                <p>The subject site is first investigated remotely, via desktop study. <br>
                The communities of the site surroundings, the current social, economic, environmental and political situations of the region must be assessed, together with the existing social / community services for the subject site and the communities of the site surroundings. <br>
                An on-site investigation trip may be arranged at this point, if deemed necessary. <br>
                This has to be approved first by the Committee Chairman. <br>
                During the on-site survey trip, site location will be assessed and site communities will be interviewed, together with communities’ leaders. A detailed account of of the surrounding natural environment, infrastructure, social and livelihood provisions will be drafted. <br>
                It is recommended to use a GIS-enabled survey App during on-site investigation. <br>
                Deliverables from this on-site investigation trip should be all useful data necessary to create a detailed project brief, including maps, data, photos, videos and reference documents. <br>
                For HKPC, if feasible reference survey in <a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.3b HKPC- Household Safety and Env Survey Form R1.xlsx" download> Appendix 13.2.3b HKPC- Household Safety and Env Survey Form</a>. </p>
                <p>4.   Project Brief</p>
                <p>The first step towards the creation of a detailed Project Brief is to do a Feasibility Study. <br>
                Teams are encouraged to carry out problem-tree analysis, shortlist the problems identified, determine their root causes and problem categorization. This will allow them to identify potential scope of works and prioritize feasible goals, while also pointing out any potential risks.</p>
                <p>If the Feasibility Study is positive, the team can proceed to create a formal Project Brief. <br>
                This will be useful to establish the project goals, objectives and deliverables, the potential impact to the beneficiaries and the work relation to the UN SDGs. <br>
                At this point it is useful to clarify the preliminary timelines of the potential works and to start working on the design inception of the potential works, together with a rough budget of the potential works. <br>
                A project team can be proposed at this stage together with a candidate review engineer. </p>
                <p>To assist in the creation of this Project Brief, it will be helpful to consult the Project Brief Checklist (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.3 - Project Brief Checklist.pdf" download>Appendix 13.2.3</a>).</p>
                <p>5.   Project Approval and MOU</p>
                <p>Once the Project Brief is completed, a formal Project Approval Form (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.4 - Project Approval Form.pptx" download>Appendix 13.2.4</a>) needs to be filled in by the team and submitted to the Committee Chair together with all of the other documents (Project Brief and Partner Handbook signed). <br>
                Documents relative to the project will be reviewed by the Committee and once the project is approved at Committee level, it will need to be endorsed by the Board of Director. <br>
                At this point an MOU is signed between EWB-HK and the partner organization.  <br>
                For HKPC, complete <a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.4b 501 - HKPC Project Application Form.doc" download> Appendix 13.2.4b - HKPC Project Application Form</a>.</p>
                <h4>EXECUTE: Provide detailed drawings and specifications to allow for project execution</h4>
                <p>6.   Design</p>
                <p>At this stage the project scopes, design parameters and local technical parameters are updated.  <br>
                A detailed design is prepared in form of a scheme design (hand sketch or CAD) or reference drawings from other sources, to show the spatial relationship, major dimensions, materials and construction methods. <br>
                Relevant technical specifications need to be drafted  (local government standards and industry practice shall be given / supported by the local partner). </p>
                <p>If applicable, the team creates a preliminary schedule of material quantities and price rate templates (the materials’ unit rate shall be obtained by the local partner in the local market). </p>
                <p>7.   Tender</p>
                <p>The team prepares a simple contract document for tender / quotation seeking  (tender / quotation process shall be carried out by the local partner). This will need to include terms and conditions and roles and responsibilities for the project. <br>
                Tender can be drafted using the Tender Process Guidelines (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.5 - Tender Process Guidelines.pptx" download>Appendix 13.2.5</a>). <br>
                Terms and Conditions can be drafted along the form provided in T&C Template (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.6 - T_C template.docx" download> Appendix 13.2.6</a>). <br>
                The Tender Process Guidelines make reference to Specifications Divisions (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.7 - Specifications Divisions.xlsx" download>Appendix 13.2.7</a>), which Project Leaders are invited to use as much as possible. <br>
                A General Specifications Template (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.8 -  GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS.docx" download>Appendix 13.2.8</a>) is also provided. </p>
                <p>Once all documents are drafted, EWB-HK’s local partner will carry out the tender. <br>
                All tender submissions will be assessed by EWB-HK’s team and a written recommendation of the appropriate contractor will be submitted to partner approval.  <br>
                Analysis is based on cost, quality, completeness, past performance, ability to meet schedule, suggestion of alternatives, others. <br>
                Once approval is obtained by local partner, all construction drawings, specs, schedule and methodology will be reviewed again with contractor and a formal agreement will be signed between the local partner and the contractor. </p>
                <p><i>It is important to note that any work done by EWB-HK abroad should be presented as “Reference Only” (for example: “Construction Reference Drawings”), since our members very likely do not have a licence to operate locally during a project trip and we do not want to expose our members to professional liabilities. </i></p>
                <h4>MONITOR: Monitor construction/project progress.</h4>
                <p>8.   Construction Monitoring</p>
                <p>Monitoring will be conducted for the most remotely after the project is started, as it is unlikely that the whole project will be conducted during one single service trip. <br>
                EWB-HK will be invited to review, comment on, raise issues on projects based on photos and routine reports sent to them by the local partner. <br>
                Frequency and terms of this type of reporting should be agreed with the local partner and contractor before leaving the project site. These type of reports can be filed by local partner and contractor using EWB-HK’s Construction Progress Report (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.9 - Construction Progress Report.xlsx" download> Appendix 13.2.9</a>). <br>
                EWB-HK personnel will advise their professional opinion to the local partner via Construction Observation Forms (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.10 Construction Observ Form.doc" download>Appendix 13.2.10</a>) </p>
                <p>Further on-site construction supervision shall be limited to the agreed times and days with the local partner. The usual practice may be a once-off on-site visit for critical stages of the project co-defined with the local partner and the contractor (ie: foundations, footings, reinforcement stages).</p>
                <p>8a.   Project Status Report  </p>
                <p>More thorough reports are sent to EWB-HK upon completion of major parts of the project work. At these points of “substantial completion” EWB-HK will be invited to examine the work (remotely or on-site) and assess any potential deficiency through a Deficiency List (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.11 -Deficiency List.doc" download>Appendix 13.2.11</a>). <br>
                The goal of the Deficiency List production is a thorough comparison of the project achievements with the goals highlighted in the Project Brief and the General Specifications. </p>
                <h4>CLOSE: Close the project and evaluate. </h4>
                <p>9.   Project Completion </p>
                <p>This on-site handover inspection shall be carried out at the completion of the construction work. <br>
                Handover inspection shall include visual inspection of the completed provisions to find out whether the completed work is generally complying with the intended design, if construction is of acceptable quality and if the required scope of the work has been met. </p>
                <p>A proper Project Close-Out Report (<a href="appendices/Appendix 13.2.12 - Project Close-out Form.docx" download>Appendix 13.2.12</a>) is filed after the inspection. </p>
                <p>The handover documents shall be inspected. <br>
                Construction drawings, materials submissions, test reports, construction method statement, testing and commissioning method statement, as-built drawings, operation and maintenance manuals, as submitted by the local contractors will be reviewed (submissions directly given by the local contractors to EWB-HK Project Team shall NOT be accepted. EWB-HK Project Team shall accept submissions, feedbacks and communication between EWB-HK Project Team and the local partner ONLY).</p>
                <p>After witnessing the handover of the completed provisions from the Contractor to the local Partner, Project Team will recommend final payment and attend the handover ceremony (usually organized by local partner)</p>
                <p>10.  Project Close-out </p>
                <p>This is an opportunity to create records from the project, so that they can be used for learning and experience. <br> Feedback is shared between EWB-HK and the local partner about the successes and failures of the project (Process, Communications, Design, Interactions, Time, Money). <br>
                “Lessons Learned” are identified:  possible improvements for other similar projects are drafted and duly filed in the EWB-HK repository server. <br>
                Deliverables obtained during projects are measured against the Initial Project Scope and the UN SDGs. <br>
                A full “Post-Mortem” of the project is filed, reviewing effectiveness, management, objectives met, relationships, opportunities, partnerships, failures and successes.</p>
                <p>11.  Post-Project Monitoring </p>
                <p>EWB-HK will maintain correspondence with the local partner and occasional require updates on the status of the project, to ensure continuity of the project and a positive legacy. <br>
                In most cases, projects are fully “closed-out” and transferred entirely to local partners for follow up. </p>
                <h3>13.3   “Disclaimer” to the External Party</h3>
                <p>The finalized Disclaimer shall be included in all formal service or engineering project proposal / report submission to the external party:  </p>
                <p><i>
