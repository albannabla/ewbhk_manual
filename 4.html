                <h2> SECTION 4: CODE OF CONDUCT
                </h2>
                <p>EWB-HK is an organization of like-minded people who share a common vision, and embark on a common mission.  This group has decided to put aside their political differences, religious beliefs and personal financial interests to come together to pursue the common vision. <br>
				The Engineers Without Borders (Hong Kong) Limited Handbook attempts to lay out in specific behaviours to be agreed by all those who volunteer to take part to work in EWB-HK’s missions or take part in its activities. <br>
				For details, please refer to the Handbook in <a href="appendices/Appendix 3.5.1 EWB-HK Handbook (Eng) (v20180401).pdf" download> Appendix 3.5.1 - EWB-HK Handbook (English version)</a>   and <a href="appendices/Appendix 3.5.2 EWB-HK Handbook (Chi) 工作手册 (v20180401).pdf" download> Appendix 3.5.2 (Chinese version)</a>.
				</p>
                <h3>4.1 Introduction
                </h3>
                <p>This code of conduct applies to all members who work for EWB-HK, regardless of rank or level, board director, ordinary member, volunteer, part-time or full-time, here in after collectively referred to as ‘Personnel’. Where specific policies apply only to a specific group or role, it would be explicitly mentioned in the document.
                <br>EWB-HK undertakes to build up responsible and independent governance mechanisms and appropriate human resource capacity and capability to deliver our work and value. <br>However, it is as equally important as for each personnel in EWB-HK to manifest the value and spirit of our mission via action and behaviour. 
                </p>
                <h3>4.2 Breach of code
                </h3>
                <p>Any violation of the Code of Conduct must be reported to the Person-in-Charge (PIC) appointed by the EWB-HK Board of Directors, or the partner hosting NGO to take appropriate action. Personnel must report any form of discrimination, retaliation or harassment, including sexual or gender harassment, and any form of sexual exploitation and abuse. 
                <br>EWB-HK and personnel are obliged to cooperate with any duly authorised audits and investigations. 
                <br>If personnel are found to have acted in breaching of the code, EWB-HK will take appropriate enforcement measures against the related personnel, depending on the severity of the action, up to and including revocation of membership.
                <br>If, after proper investigation, there are credible allegations of serious misconduct, these cases may, upon consultation with EWB-HK Legal Adviser, be referred to local authorities.
                </p>
                <h3>4.3 Principles </h3>
                <h4>a)  Humanitarian imperative comes first. 
                </h4>
                <p>The right to receive humanitarian assistance, and to offer it, is a fundamental humanitarian principle which should be enjoyed by all citizens of all countries. Personnel recognises the obligation to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed.
                </p>
                <h4>b)  Uphold the standard. 
                </h4>
                <p>Personnel shall uphold and promote the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct as well as values, including and not limited to honesty, transparency, commitment, engagement, solidarity, efficiency, competence and integrity. 
                <br>Personnel shall always act with care. While EWB-HK welcomes any form of support provided from our personnel, personnel shall acknowledge their competence in specific areas and perform service according to their competence. 
                <br>Unless personnel are designated to take control of the project, personnel shall never affix their signatures to any plans or documents. Personnel shall advise the beneficiaries truthfully about the progress of the project, or whether the project would be successfully completed. 
                <br>Personnel shall avoid the use of statements containing material misrepresentation of facts or omitting a material fact. </p>
                <p>Personnel shall acknowledge their errors and shall not distort or alter the facts. 
                <br>Personnel shall follow the instructions of the team leader designated by EWB-HK and not pursue private interests. 
                <br>Personnel should raise a concern about a danger, risk, malpractice or wrongdoing which affects others, and support other personnel to raise the concern. 
                <br>Given they have evaluated their competency, Personnel is entitled to review and evaluate the work of others when required so. However, any form of appropriate suggestion is encouraged.   
                <br>Personnel is encouraged to share their technical knowledge, idea and expertise with other personnel within the project. </p>
                <p>Personnel shall not use their function in EWB-HK or knowledge obtained from EWB-HK for the private benefit of him/herself or others, nor to the detriment of others. 
                <br>While EWB-HK pays the highest respect to personnel’s religious and political value, personnel is expected to put aside their political differences, religious beliefs and personal financial interests to come together to pursue the shared vision. </p>
                <p>Personnel shall guide by the motivation to devote our knowledge and abilities without regard to financial remuneration or other financial interest. 
                <br>Personnel should not abuse his/her connection with other institution outside EWB-HK. </p>
                <p>EWB-HK may sometimes act as an institutional link in the partnership between those who wish to assist and those who need assistance. We, therefore, hold ourselves accountable to both constituencies.</p>
                <p>We recognize the need to report on our activities, both from a financial perspective and the perspective of effectiveness. We recognize the obligation to ensure appropriate monitoring of aid distributions and to carry out regular assessments of the impact of disaster assistance.
                </p>
                <h4>c)  Equality 
                </h4>
                <p>Personnel shall uphold, respect and be loyal to the principles set out in the UN Millennium Development Goals, UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Earth Charter, the dignity and worth of the human and the equal rights of men and women. 
                <br>Consequently, personnel will show respect for all person equally and shall not discriminate against any individual or group of individuals. </p>
                <p>Personnel is expected to act with tolerance, sensitivity and respect for differences. Any form of prohibited conduct in the workplace or in connection with work is a violation of these principles and may lead to disciplinary action, whether the prohibited conduct takes place in the workplace, in the course of official travel or an official mission, or in other settings in which it may have an impact on the workplace. 
                <br>Personnel is obliged to ensure that they do not engage in or condone behaviour which would constitute prohibited conduct with respect to their peers, supervisors, supervisees and other persons performing duties for EWB-HK.
                </p>
                <h4>d)  Respect for the community 
                </h4>
                <p>Personnel shall respect the local dietary practices and make every effort to deal with any differences.
                <br>Personnel shall endeavour to respect the culture, structures and customs of the communities and countries. Personnel will respect the local norm on dress code and avoid inappropriate dressing.
                <br>Personnel shall portray an objective image of the humanitarian situation where the capacities and aspirations of victims are highlighted, and not just their vulnerabilities and fears.
                <br>We recognise the crucial role played by women in disaster-prone communities and will ensure that this role is supported, not diminished, by our aid programmes.
                </p>
                <h4>e)  Indiscriminate Aid  
                </h4>
                <p>The priority of Humanitarian aid shall be given on the basis of need alone. Personnel shall provide humanitarian aid regardless of the race, colour, gender, language, religion, political views, nationality, ethnicity, sexual preference or status and without adverse distinction of any kind. </p>
                <p>Provision of aid will reflect the degree of suffering it seeks to alleviate. Wherever possible, we will base the provision of aid upon a thorough assessment of the needs of the recipients and the local capacities already in place to meet those needs. Within the entirety of our programmes, we will reflect considerations of proportionality. </p>
                <p>Personnel must not tie the promise, delivery or distribution of assistance to the embracing or acceptance of any political or religious creed or any interest.
                <br>Every humanitarian aid provided by personnel is not a partisan nor political act and should not be viewed as such. </p>
                <p>Personnel should not allow external or internal demands for publicity to take precedence over the principle of maximising overall relief assistance.
                <br>EWB-HK will avoid competing with other disaster response agencies for media coverage in situations where such coverage may be to the detriment of the service provided to the beneficiaries or the security of our staff or the beneficiaries.</p>
                <h4>f) Sustainability</h4>
                <p>Where possible, personnel should always work through local partners at the planning and implementation stages, employing local staff, purchasing local materials, trading with local companies and cooperating with local government structures where appropriate.
                <br>Effective relief and lasting rehabilitation can best be achieved where the intended beneficiaries are involved in the design, management and implementation of the assistance program. EWB-HK strives to achieve full community participation in our relief and rehabilitation programs, which actively reduce the beneficiaries’ vulnerability to future disasters and help create sustainable lifestyles.
                <br>Personnel should pay particular attention to environmental concerns in the design and management throughout the project, endeavour to minimise the negative impact of humanitarian assistance, seeking to avoid long-term beneficiary dependence upon external aid, and minimise the wasting of valuable resources.
                </p>
                <h4>g)  Avoid personal liabilities 
                </h4>
                <p>Personnel must comply with local laws and honour our private legal obligations. 
                <br>While working on the overseas project, personnel must always be careful not to contravene any local law. Offenders are responsible for their legal liabilities. </p>
                <p>EWB-HK will do its best to assist personnel if accidents are encountered that may cause harm to people or property damage during a mission. However, personnel must acknowledge that EWB-HK is not liable for any such loss. 
                <br>Before engaging in overseas missions, personnel is warmly advised purchasing dedicated travel insurance to cover any personal damage or loss.
                </p>
                <h4>h)  Avoid conflicts of interest 
                </h4>
                <p>Personnel shall fully disclose conflicts of interest to the appropriate party in any extent. 
                <br>Personnel shall seek consultation and direction from responsible personnel in EWB-HK before engaging in activities that may place them in a position of conflict of interest.
                <br>EWB-HK’s work does not require any form of reward or pay. 
                <br>Personnel should refrain from accepting any compensation or reward from the recipients of EWB-HK's work. </p>
                <p>EWB-HK will never knowingly – or through negligence – allow personnel to be used to gather information of a political, military or economically sensitive nature for governments or other bodies that may serve purposes other than those which are strictly humanitarian, nor will act as instruments of foreign policy of donor governments, nor will act as instruments of foreign policy of the governments.</p>
                <p>Personnel shall also not to use positions, material or resource in EWB-HK to run for public office, promote a particular political party or religion.
                </p>
                <h4>i)  Condemnation of sexual abuse 
                </h4>
                <p>Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse violate universally recognised international legal norms and standards and therefore constitute acts of serious misconduct. 
                <br>Personnel must not engage in any form of harassment as well as all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. 
                <br>For the protection of all parties involved, the following specific standards are promulgated:
                </p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Sexual activity with children (persons under the age of 18) is prohibited regardless of the age of majority or age of consent locally. Mistaken belief in the age of a child is not a defence.
                    </li>
                    <li>Exchange of money, employment, goods or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour, is prohibited. This includes any exchange of assistance that is due to the beneficiaries.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sexual relationships between EWB-HK personnel and beneficiaries of assistance undermine the credibility and integrity of the work of the EWB-HK and are strongly discouraged. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Where Personnel develops concerns or suspicions regarding sexual exploitation or sexual abuse by a fellow worker, whether in the same agency or not and whether or not within the EWB framework, he or she must report such concerns via established reporting mechanisms.
                    </li>
                    <li>Personnel is obliged to create and maintain an environment that prevents sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. Managers at all levels have a particular responsibility to support and develop systems that maintain this environment.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The standards set out above are not an exhaustive list. 
                </p>
                <p>Other types of sexually exploitative or sexually abusive behaviour may be grounds for administrative action and/or disciplinary measures, including summary dismissal, pursuant to EWB-HK conditions of deployment.
                <br>Personnel shall be treated with dignity and respect and to work in an environment free from prohibited conduct as described above.
