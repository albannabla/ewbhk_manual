                <h2>SECTION 11: TRAVEL</h2>
                <h3>11.1 Travel Safety and Health Procedures</h3>
                <p>Prior to finalizing your group’s travel plans, each member of the group should do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill out the Travel Team Checklist (<a href="appendices/Appendix 11.1.1 - Travel Team Checklist.doc" download>Appendix 11.1.1</a>) and hand it to the project leader.</li>
                    <li>Review the Tips and Recommendations as per Section 11.4 of this Manual</li>
                    <li>Fill out the Health Questionnaire (<a href="appendices/Appendix 11.1.2 - Health Questionnaire.docx" download>Appendix 11.1.2</a>) and give it to the health point person (HPP) traveling on the project. </li>
                    <li>Prepare a medical kit using the First Aid Kit Content form (<a href="appendices/Appendix 11.1.3 - First Aid Kit Content.doc" download>Appendix 11.1.3</a>) as a guideline.</li>
                    <li>Fill out the Responsibility Waiver (<a href="appendices/Appendix 11.1.4 - Responsibility Waiver.docx" download>Appendix 11.1.4</a>) and send it to the EWB-HK staff prior to travel (should be submitted with the assessment or implementation presentation).</li>
                    <li>Obtain a list of emergency contacts from your Team Leader and make sure the list is packed and always at hand</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>11.2 Vaccinations</h3>
                <p>All EWB volunteers traveling to a foreign country are expected to get the recommended vaccinations for their travel destination. <br>
                Information on these vaccinations can be found at your doctor’s office, travel clinics or through the World Health Organization (WHO) or Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
                </p>
                <h3>11.3 What to do before a trip</h3>
                <p>It is suggested that the Project Leader obtain advance information for the specific countries that will be visited. Valuable information on travel safety can be obtained from: Peace Corps offices, Embassy offices, travel agencies, airlines, etc.</p>
                <p>Check all customs regulations if bringing in items to the country, especially if your team will be brining expensive items.</p>
                <p>Each volunteer and their family need to make an informed decision as to their safety while out of the country.</p>
                <p>Checklist of most important items:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Valid passports</li>
                    <li>Visas</li>
                    <li>trip insurance</li>
                    <li>vaccinations</li>
                    <li>health and trip insurance</li>
                    <li>medical evacuation insurance</li>
                    <li>foreign exchange</li>
                    <li>project components packed and ready</li>
                    <li>EWB liability waivers in place</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Health Point person should have a completed Personal Health Checklist for each person on the project team, a first aid kit and a list of key contact phone numbers and Embassy Contact number in host country. <br>
                The Personal Health Checklist for each person is to be taken on the trip, should a situation arises where this information is needed.
                </p>
                <p>Useful items recommended your team carries on field trip include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GPS & hand level</li>
                    <li>satellite phones</li>
                    <li>first aid and medical supply kit</li>
                    <li>list of key contact phone numbers</li>
                    <li>Embassy Contact number in host country</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Distribute information on location of nearest medical facilities in the field, etc., verify and distribute emergency contacts and village contacts to all project participants.
                </p>
                <p>Develop an emergency plan and an exit strategy.</p>
                <p>Schedule a Travel Readiness Review two to four weeks before the project trip. Verify all team travel logistics, budgets, and funds. </p>
                <p>Provide host country cultural information to trip participants.</p>
                <p>Prepare team members for cultural differences - higher population density, fewer comforts of sanitation, temperature control, etc., and the possibility of seeing people, particularly children and animals, in dire conditions.
                </p>
                <h3>11.4 What to do during a trip: tips and recommendations</h3>
                <p>Make sure that project leaders know always where you are.</p>
                <p>Abide at all times to local legislation and to the EWB-HK Code of Conduct. </p>
                <p>Make sure all expenses are properly accounted for and receipts are kept. </p>
                <p>Refrain from alcohol use and mind altering drugs whether they are legal or illegal in the project country; bribery, culturally inappropriate behavior, and sexual relations with members of the traveling team or partner communities. <br>
                Mantain open mindedness and preferably avoid conversations about political, economic, and religious opinions.
                </p>
                <p>Ask trustworthy partner NGO members upon arrival about common practise and the local safety tips. </p>
                <p>Don't bring expensive items or large amount of cash on the trip, use an ATM card or credit card instead if at all possible. </p>
                <p>If possible, travel with a locally purchased or rented mobile telephone. These are increasingly available in almost all countries.</p>
                <p>Always keep your hotel door locked. Always sleep in locked and secured accommodations.</p>
                <p>Look for fire safety instructions in your hotel room.</p>
                <p>Always lock your baggage. </p>
                <p>Keep one hand free to protect yourself and your valuables.</p>
                <p>Bring sufficient local currency for daily expense and emergency. </p>
                <p>Meet visitors in the lobby.</p>
                <p>Inform someone, including the front desk, when you expect to return if you will be out late at night.</p>
                <p>Avoid being alone. If absolutely needed, make sure that someone knows where you are and where you will be.</p>
                <p>Adhere to advice on districts or regions to avoid.</p>
                <p>Avoid any item that declares your nationality or political beliefs.</p>
