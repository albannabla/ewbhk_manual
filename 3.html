                <h2>SECTION 3: ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE</h2>
                <h3>3.1.1 Structure</h3>
                <p>EWB is organized in four major service units: Hong Kong Project Committee, Overseas Project Committee, Young Members Group and Humanitarian Engineering Training Committee, plus a few others working groups and administrative committees.
                <br>All service units report directly to the EWB-HK Board of Directors. 
                <br>The Board of Directors delegates many of its powers to a Chairman. 
                <br>All committees are composed of members of the organization. Committees also manage and supervise volunteers (occasional or long-term), who can occasionally be organized in workgroups or teams. 
                <br>Besides Directors, members and committees, EWB-HK further include Student and Professional Chapters. These Chapters are independent entities spontaneously formed by students or professionals, but they are supervised and directed by EWB-HK permanent committees.   </p>
                <h3>3.1.2 Organization Chart</h3>

                Directors are elected during alternate Annual General Meetings (i.e. once every two years). 
                <br>Candidates for the office of Director need to have been members of EWB-HK for at least 3 years and need to be nominated by a Director other than the candidate himself and seconded by two other Directors at least 10 days before the General Meeting at which he/she is proposed to be elected.

                </p>
                <p>A Director shall vacate office: </p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>if a receiving order is made against him or he/she makes any arrangement or composition  with his creditors; or </li>
                    <li>if he/she dies or becomes of unsound mind whilst in office; or </li>
