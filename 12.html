                <h2>SECTION 12: FINANCE/FUNDING</h2>
                <h3>12.1 Description and General Information</h3>
                <p>EWB-HK is a nonprofit, humanitarian organization, we rely on the generosity and philanthropy of supporters to fund our work. Donations form a key part of our income which in turn helps us support inspirational community organizations as well as nurturing and empowering future community development professionals prepared to make a difference. The contribution will not only directly support our existing community and educational programs but will help us scale up our efforts to reach further and have greater impact.</p>
                <p>All donations, whether via fundraising or grants, are managed by the Financial Team, led by the EWB-HK Treasurer together with all Committees' Financial Directors (if any of them have been appointed).</p>
                <p>EWB-HK is a registered non-profit organization (NGO) in Hong Kong and therefore all donations are tax deductible according to Hong Kong S.A.R. legislation. Our Financial Team will be happy to provide receipts for tax deduction purpose. <br>
                Donations to EWB-HK from abroad may not be tax deductible in other countries. 
                </p>
                <h3>12.2 Types of funding</h3>
                <p>EWB-HK receives funds from the following sources:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Membership fees and annual subscriptions</li>
                    <li>Donation from members, philanthropic organizations and external individuals</li>
                    <li>Fundraising events</li>
                    <li>Grants</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Donations can be processed according to <a href="appendices/Appendix 12.2.1 - Donation Methods.docx" download> Appendix 12.2.1 - Donation Methods</a>. </p>
                <h3>12.3 Fundraising </h3>
                <p>Members and volunteers may periodically organize fundraising events to help EWB-HK and other communities. Fundraising ideas can be collected from members and volunteers but they need to be vetted by EWB-HK's Treasurer before any action is taken. <br>
                Common ideas for fundraising events are:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Convincing a Corporate Donor to join the cause</li>
                    <li>Launch a Fundraising Campaign via online Social Media for a particular project by EWB-HK</li>
                    <li>Organize a local Fundraising Event (party, sport event, etc.)</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>12.4 Grants </h3>
                <p>Grants from Universities or other Organizations can be applied for, as long as the related funds are deposited onto EWB-HK's official Bank Account and the application is vetted and approved by EWB-HK's Treasurer. <br>
                Student Chapters or Committees can propose Grant Applications to BoD or Treasurer for vetting. EWB-HK's Financial Team will perform appropriate due-diligence of grant proposal submitted. </p>
                <h3>12.5 General Terms on Funding</h3>
                <p>EWB-HK's financial records must pass an annual audit and should follow generally accepted accounting principals, conforming legislation in Hong Kong S.A.R. relative to non-profit organizations. <br>
                EWB-HK's reputation and integrity is also at stake, so when unsure always contact EWB-HK's Financial Team for clarification. <br>
                Following are some sound principles that should be adhered to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>all official expenses should be properly filed in the central EWB-HK repository and approved by Financial Team. All filed expenses should use EWB-HK Expense Claim Form (<a href="appendices/Appendix 12.5.1 - Expense Claim Form.xlsx" download="">Appendix 12.5.1</a>) and should have attached a proper receipt of the actual expenditure. </li>
                    <li>funding must be used according to the original published intent. If funds were raised for a particular project, they can only be allocated for us on that project and cannot be diverted to other general expenditures. </li>
                    <li>new funding cannot be used for past expenses (i.e. expenses occurred before the funding was received or to pay off a deficit) </li>
                    <li>EWB-HK's Financial Team has the final word on how to manage, hold and administer the funds: even if a Committee has worked on a fundraising events, it is not automatic that the Financial Team will allocate the raised funds to the same Committee. </li>
                    <li>There are no exceptions to the deadlines stated in grant award letters. Failure to meet deadlines may result in repayments of the entire grant, therefore members and teams who have been allocated funds will be liable to ensure deadlines are met and funds are used correctly. Sanctions may be levied at EWB-HK's sole discretion, in this case. </li>
                </ul>
