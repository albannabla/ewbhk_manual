                YMG is a platform to gather young persons and students to organize activities in line with our missions. In these few years, YMG has been successfully developed and completed several self-financed engineering-based service trips in the Mainland China and Cambodia.

                <h3>8.5 Global Citizenship Program</h3>
                <p>The UN Sustainable Development Goals have provided a key challenge for todays engineers in a humanitarian, ethical and technical perspective.  The education of the engineer is very heavily focused on the technical aspects.  The challenge now is to develop in our young engineers the social responsibility to strive for sustainable human development, the UN SDG’s and all Global Challenges.  </p>
                <p>Engineers, who possess technological solutions to global development problems and challenges, play an important role in promoting sustainable development and implementing innovative solutions.  The <strong>EWB-HK Global Citizenship Program </strong>creates a real and transformative experience by envisaging engineering and science students to commit themselves in building a sustainable world with engineering solutions and becoming our future global leaders in sustainable development. </p>
                <p>The program offers a real and transformative experience to plan and implement solutions to engineering based projects to achieve the SDG’s.  The GCP Program Goal is to provide a platform for future engineering leaders to explore the global challenges, to serve the society proactively with global vision, to contribute to the sustainable development goals as global citizens.  <br>
                The Program Approaches Awareness Building, Community Services, Capacity Building, Appropriate Technology, Network Building.
                </p>
                <p>It delivers experiences through 7 Workshops; 2 Local Community Service Excursions; 1 International (Myanmar) Excursion; and a Post Trip Evaluation/Ideation Workshop.  The program is also supported by an Industry Mentorship program.  The outcome of the program is the <strong>“Change”</strong> of young engineers in the sense of global citizenship.  They advance from a conventional engineer to being an engineer with global vision, capable to embrace cross-discipline collaboration.</p>
                <p>Details on the EWB-HK Global Citizenship Program can found in <a href="appendices/Appendix 8.5.1 GCP19 Program.pptx" download> Appendix 8.5.1</a></p>
