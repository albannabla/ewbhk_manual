                            </li>   
                            <li>EWB is open to engineering students and non-engineering students alike.</li>                         
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                </ol>
                <h3>9.4 How to start a Student Chapter</h3>
                <p>Before starting a chapter, it is necessary to have in place:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>A driven leader: This person can either be a faculty member or a student</li>
                    <li>A few excited students: we recommend a minimum of 3 people for each chapter. </li>
                    <li>Faculty support: We have found that having a faculty member, and/or the Dean behind the chapter, provides continuity and guarantees official support.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Once enough people are interested in starting a Student Chapter, the next step is to contact EWB-HK, namely the Young Member Group, which will operate as a reference for all Student Chapters. <br>
                EWB-HK will provide information on how to formally start the Chapter and will require each chapter to submit a formal <a href="appendices/Appendix 9.4.1 - Student Chapter Startup Form.xls" download> Student Chapter Startup Form</a>. <br>
                The Form should be submitted at the beginning of each school year.
                </p>
                <h3>9.5 Student Chapters Structure</h3>
                <p>Each student chapter must have at least an energetic leader who is willing to put enough time to make the Chapter successful. This leader is nominated President of the Chapter. <br>
                Each chapter must have a President. If other strong-willed individuals are willing to help the President managing the Chapter, they can be nominated Deputy Presidents of the Chapter. <br>
                Other officers may include a Secretary and a Treasurer, to the President discretion and based on the size of the Chapter. The only mandatory officer for each chapter is the President. <br>
                All officers remain in power for the entire student year and can be replaced for the next year, upon submission of a new Startup Form. 
                </p>
                <p>Representation of each Students Chapter is assured via a Standing Committee, which interacts directly with EWB-HK and includes representatives from all Student Chapters in Hong Kong. </p>
                <p>The Standing Committee is formed by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Student Chapter Representatives</li>
                    <li>Ex Student Chapter Representatives</li>
                    <li>Graduate Volunteers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The seats on the committee are assigned as following: </p>
